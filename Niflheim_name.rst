In `Nordic mythology <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology>`_
Niflheim_ is the land of fog and ice, and Niflheim_ is part of the `myth of creation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology#The_beginning>`_:
When the heat from Muspelheim_ melted the first drops of water from the ice of Niflheim_, these drops formed into the giant Ymer, the first living creature. 
When Ymer was later killed, his dead body was molded into the world as we know it.

The NIFLHEIM cluster supercomputer is actually housed in a basement room with chilled air cooling, 
and NIFLHEIM is thus bitterly cold. 
This room is officially known as the *Fog Room* (in Danish: *Tågerummet*) because it was originally built with the purpose of 
experiments in the mid-1960'ies by Prof. R. E. H. Rasmussen trying to precipitate fog using electrical fields.
