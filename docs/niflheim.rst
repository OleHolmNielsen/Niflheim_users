Niflheim overview
=================

The *Niflheim Linux cluster supercomputer* is installed at the 
`Department of Physics <https://www.fysik.dtu.dk/english>`_ at the 
`Technical University of Denmark <https://www.dtu.dk/english>`_.
Niflheim's present compute resources consist of about 700 compute nodes containing 31000 CPU cores 
with a total peak performance of more than 2255 TeraFLOPS_ (2255 million million floating-point operations per second).
Please see the :ref:`Hardware` page for further details.

Access to Niflheim
==================

Niflheim is available to all HPC users (staff as well as students) at DTU.

DTU departments who have not used Niflheim previously should first contact Prof. Karsten W. Jacobsen (kwja@dtu.dk) so that new user groups and disk space can be allocated.

Existing user groups on Niflheim should send requests for new users to the :ref:`Niflheim_support` E-mail. 

Usage of Niflheim
=================

Please consult the :ref:`Niflheim_Getting_started` page for information about how to use the Niflheim system.

For Niflheim usage statistics please see the monthly `Niflheim accounting reports <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/graphs/accounting_reports.html>`_.

Niflheim software stack

The name Niflheim
=================

The NIFLHEIM cluster supercomputer was given a name through a naming competition held at the *CAMP research center* in the summer of 2002.

About Niflheim_mythology_:
In `Nordic mythology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology>`_
*Niflheim* is the land of fog and ice, and *Niflheim* is part of the `myth of creation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology#The_beginning>`_:
When the heat from Muspelheim_ melted the first drops of water from the ice of Niflheim_, these drops formed into the giant Ymer, the first living creature. 
When Ymer was later killed, his dead body was molded into the world as we know it.

Read more about the Edda prose containing the Nordic myth of creation,
see `Prose Edda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda>`_
(see the `Gylfaginning <https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm>`_ from *IV. Gangleri said*, in other
translations known as *Frá Niflheimi ok Múspelli* section).

The NIFLHEIM cluster supercomputer was originally housed in a basement room with chilled air cooling, and NIFLHEIM is thus bitterly cold. 
This room is officially known as the *Fog Room* (in Danish: *Tågerummet*) because it was originally built with the purpose of 
experiments in the mid-1960'ies by Prof. R. E. H. Rasmussen trying to precipitate fog using electrical fields.
